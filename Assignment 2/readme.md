## Assignment 2

### Assignment 2(a):-
 Write a C program that takes as input a list of processes, their arrival times and their CPU
burst times. Schedule the processes into the CPU using Longest Time First (LJF) and Shortest 
Remaining Time First (SRTF) algorithms. For any tie breaking condition apply FCFS algorithm. 
Print the Gantt chart. Also compute their average waiting time and average turn around time.


### Assignment 2(b):-
 Write a C program that takes as input a list of processes, their arrival times and their CPU
burst times. Schedule the processes into the CPU using Round Robin algorithm. Take the time 
quantum as user input. Print the Gantt chart. Also compute their average waiting time and 
average turn around time.


### Assignment 2(c):-
 Write a C program that takes as input a list of processes, their arrival times and their CPU
burst times. Schedule the processes into the CPU using both preemptive and non-preemptive
Priority based scheduling algorithms. For any tie breaking condition apply FCFS algorithm. Print 
the Gantt chart. Also compute their average waiting time and average turn around time
